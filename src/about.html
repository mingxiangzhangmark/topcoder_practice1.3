    I have been on an enriching journey of personal and academic growth, marked by key milestones and achievements in my education and professional life. My foundation was laid at WUYI Middle School, where I spent formative years from 2014 to 2017 as a dedicated student, building a strong academic base and nurturing a lifelong passion for learning. 

    In 2022, I joined WestNorthern Polytechnical University, where I further honed my skills and knowledge. This period of higher education was a significant step forward, offering me opportunities to explore my academic interests and develop a deeper understanding of my chosen field. My time at the university was defined by a commitment to excellence and a drive to expand my intellectual horizons.
    
    In 2024, I embraced a new challenge as an English tutor at a training school. This role allowed me to leverage my communication skills and contribute to the development of others, fostering a sense of responsibility and accomplishment. Teaching enhanced my ability to connect with people and strengthened my leadership and mentoring skills.
    
    Looking ahead, my journey continues at the University of Sydney (USYD), starting in 2025. I am excited to immerse myself in a vibrant academic environment that will enable me to pursue my aspirations and equip me with the tools to excel in a globalized world. Throughout my journey, I have consistently demonstrated resilience, adaptability, and a thirst for knowledge, traits that define me as a lifelong learner and aspiring professional.
