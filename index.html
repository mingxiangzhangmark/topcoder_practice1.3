      <h1>My Understand about HTML, CSS and Javascript</h1>
      <article>
          
          <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the foundational technologies of the web. Together, they allow developers to create visually appealing, functional, and interactive websites. Each of these technologies has a distinct purpose, and understanding their roles is crucial for web development.</p>
          <h2 id="section-html">HTML</h2>
          <p class="html">HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational building block of the web. It is the language used to create the structure and content of a webpage. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage—it defines where everything goes, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, forms, and more. HTML uses tags enclosed in angle brackets, such as h1, p, or img. These tags tell the browser how to interpret and display the content. HTML also supports attributes, which provide additional information about elements. For example, the src attribute in image tag specifies the location of an image file.

            HTML is a static language, meaning it only defines the structure of a webpage and does not include interactivity or styling. To make a webpage interactive or visually appealing, you need additional technologies like JavaScript and CSS. However, HTML5 introduced some advanced features, such as native audio and video playback, as well as semantic elements , which improve accessibility and search engine optimization. Overall, HTML is essential for creating any web presence, from simple blogs to complex e-commerce sites.  
          </p>
          <h2 id="section-css">CSS</h2>
          <p class="css">CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language that controls the presentation and layout of a webpage. While HTML provides the structure, CSS defines the visual style—colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, and even animations. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), developers can achieve cleaner and more maintainable code. CSS allows you to define styles for multiple pages in one place using external stylesheets, making it efficient to manage site-wide design consistency.

            CSS supports a variety of selectors, such as element selectors (h1), class selectors (.classname), and ID selectors (#idname), allowing you to target specific elements for styling. It also includes a box model that determines how elements are sized and positioned, along with padding, borders, and margins. Modern CSS features like Flexbox and Grid have revolutionized layout design, making it easier to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. Additionally, CSS can handle animations and transitions, bringing life to static webpages. With its versatility, CSS is a powerful tool for making websites visually stunning and user-friendly.</p>
          <h2 id="section-js">Javascript</h2>
          <p class="javascript">JavaScript is the programming language that brings life to webpages by enabling interactivity and dynamic behavior. Unlike HTML and CSS, which are declarative, JavaScript is imperative, meaning it allows developers to write instructions for how a webpage should behave. Whether it's validating forms, creating image sliders, or building interactive maps, JavaScript plays a key role in modern web development.

            One of JavaScript's most significant strengths is its versatility. It can be used on both the client side (in the browser) and the server side (with technologies like Node.js). JavaScript integrates seamlessly with HTML and CSS, allowing developers to manipulate elements on the webpage, handle events like clicks or key presses, and update content without reloading the page using technologies like AJAX. Frameworks and libraries such as React, Vue, and Angular have further expanded JavaScript's capabilities, making it a cornerstone of modern web applications.
            
            JavaScript also has access to the DOM (Document Object Model), enabling dynamic changes to webpage content. For example, you can use JavaScript to create an interactive to-do list where users can add, remove, or mark items as completed—all without refreshing the page. With its robust features and ever-evolving ecosystem, JavaScript continues to be the backbone of interactive and dynamic web experiences.</p>
